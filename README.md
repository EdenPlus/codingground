# Coding Ground
Most things I do will go here as I primarily use coding ground. If you want the latest working versions of stuff, you can check the master branch, coding ground likes to post stuff to the default branch so I made the default branch the branch that I'm actively working with and saving to (ActivityDump).

## Current Projects:
**PythonSandbox** - My Python sandbox, I use this sandbox as a way for my to experiment with stuff in Python. The stuff in here will change frequently.

**RubyToolbox** - This started out as a sandbox for me to experiment with Ruby and eventually evolved into a toolbox that I worked on to improve my skill with Ruby.

**PythonAnagram** - This is an anagram solver I made with Python. To my knowledge it only works with words/phrases that cap out with 10 characters. All characters that aren't in the english alphabet aren't counted, this includes spaces. I tested it on coding ground and at 10 characters, the program will be running for nearly an hour and anything hire will be killed for running too long.

**PythonPrimesThatSumTo** - This is a program that finds all pairs of prime numbers that have a sum of 10000 (by default). I wrote this because, I saw a job listing that wanted proof of Python skills. While I knew I couldn't actually apply for the position (I don't have any JavaScript heavy webpages yet). I ended up writing this program anyway simply because, I had gotten bored of spending the past week looking for a job to support my household and wanted to write something and this just snagged my attention. I did take a fair bit writing this simplistic program because I had to relearn Python after spending so long working with Java/JavaScript(Vanilla)/HTML/CSS/PHP and also learning Angular, Bootstrap, and SQL.

**AngularJSSandbox** - This is a sandbox website I made while teaching myself Angular. I will admit, I do very much enjoy how AngularJS works.

**Bootstrap2PageLayout** - This is a website layout I made in about an hour and a half. It is simply designed to be a wireframe parody/translation of this: https://webdesignerhut.com/responsive-layout-with-html-and-css/ (And yes, I do realise, as of updating this list, that it should be named **Bootstrap2ColumnLayout**, but I'm too lazy to change it right now). Yes, the colors are all kinds of messed up, but I did that intentionally so that it would be immediately apparent how that layout is organized.

**SQLBaroListings** - Abandoned project. I didn't have access to necessary resources to conveniently complete my intentions. May revisit in the future when I care enough.
