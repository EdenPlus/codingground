# Coding Ground
Most things I do will go here as I primarily use coding ground. If you want the latest working versions of stuff, you can check the master branch, coding ground likes to post stuff to the default branch so I made the default branch the branch that I'm actively working with and saving to (ActivityDump).

## Current Projects:
**PythonSandbox** - My Python sandbox, I use this sandbox as a way for my to experiment with stuff in Python. The stuff in here will change frequently.

**RubyToolbox** - This started out as a sandbox for me to experiment with Ruby and eventually evolved into a toolbox that I worked on to improve my skill with Ruby.

**PythonAnagram** - This is an anagram solver I made with Python. To my knowledge it only works with words/phrases that cap out with 10 characters. All characters that aren't in the english alphabet aren't counted, this includes spaces. I tested it on coding ground and at 10 characters, the program will be running for nearly an hour and anything hire will be killed for running too long.
